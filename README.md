# Astro Redux CRUD

Welcome to the Astro Redux CRUD project!

## Redux
Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. Redux provides a centralized store for managing the state of your application, making it easier to track changes and manage complex data flows.

To learn more about Redux, you can refer to the [official Redux documentation](https://redux.js.org/).
