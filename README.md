# Astro Redux CRUD

Welcome to the Astro Redux CRUD project!

## Heroicons

For this project, we are using [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/), a set of free SVG icons designed by Steve Schoger and Adam Wathan. Heroicons provide a wide range of beautiful and customizable icons that can enhance the visual appeal of your web applications.

To use Heroicons in your project, simply visit their website and browse through the available icons. You can then copy the SVG code and use it in your HTML or CSS files.

Happy coding!
